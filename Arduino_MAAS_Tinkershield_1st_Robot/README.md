# Arduino MAAS Tinkershield 1st Robot Boilerplate
Design an OOP library for a simple year 7 or 8 learning mechatrontics robot built on the MAAS Tinkershield. The core function of your mechatrontic solution is simplify the mainline with methods and extend the hardware to include a simple end effector and a UI display of states to support debugging.

## Core Components
1. MAAS Tinkershield
2. Arduino Uno
3. Uno Screwshield
3. [IIC LCD Screen](https://github.com/TempeHS/TempeHS_Ardunio_Boilerplate/tree/main/TempeHS_Sensor_Catalogue/Examples/IIC_1602_LCD)
4. 9g Micro Servo
5. Servo Clamp Gripper
6. Dupont cables
7. 9v Battery
8. 9v Battery Snap
10. 100ÂµF 25v capacitors

## Support Information
Feedback from students is that the 'Crack the code' examples are too confusing and require too many mainline commands. Feedback from educators is that it doesn't have any obvious mechatronic functions built into the hardware.

These documents and sample code will help you see how the shield and microcontroller is used in a non OOP way.
