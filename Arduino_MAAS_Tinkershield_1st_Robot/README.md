# Arduino MAAS Tinkershield 1st Robot Boilerplate
Design and build an educational robot driven by an OOP library and built on the MAAS Tinkershield. The core functions of your mechatrontic solution is to provide learners with a simplified mainline using methods and extend the hardware with a basic end effector to add a mechatronics element and a UI display of states to support user debugging.

## Core Components
1. MAAS Tinkershield
2. Arduino Uno
3. Uno Screwshield
3. [IIC LCD Screen](https://github.com/TempeHS/TempeHS_Ardunio_Boilerplate/tree/main/TempeHS_Sensor_Catalogue/Examples/IIC_1602_LCD)
4. 9g Micro Servo
5. Servo Clamp Gripper
6. Dupont cables
7. 9v Battery
8. 9v Battery Snap
10. 100ÂµF 25v capacitor

## Support Information
Feedback from students is that the 'Crack the code' examples are too confusing and require too many setup and mainline commands. Feedback from educators is that it doesn't have any obvious mechatronic functions built into the hardware.

These documents and sample code will help you see how the shield and microcontroller is used in a non OOP way.
