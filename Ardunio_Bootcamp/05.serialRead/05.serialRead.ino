  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to wire a variable resistor as a pseudo sensor and read analogue data from that PIN.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I can wire a variable resistor in TINKERCAD
    2. I know how to read analogue data from a specific PIN
    3. I know the range of analogue data
    4. I can organise output data so it correctly plots on the serial monitor
    7. I can connect digital Seeed sensors and read data from them
