   Learning Intention: The students understand how time is used in microcontrollers and best practices
    1. I understand why delay(1000) whilst easy is not the preferred way of time event management
    2. I can use the millis() method and binary logic to trigger events by time
    3. I can explain the difference and benefits in serial monitor plotting by using millis() compared to delay()
