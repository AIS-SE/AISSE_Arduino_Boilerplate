  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to wire two motors to a H-Bridge controller and control the motors speed and direction.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand what a H bidge is and what it does
    2. I can fit the shield correctly to teh Arduino
    2. I can manually write different directions and speeds to two motors
    3. I understand the advantages and disadvantages of a continuous servo over a motor and H bridge
