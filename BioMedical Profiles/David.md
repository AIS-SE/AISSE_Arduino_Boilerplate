Hi, my name is David and I want to be a chess master! I'm pretty good at chess and I having been winning competition all over Australia since I was 10 years old. A specalist nurse taught me chess as a way of learning to use my prothetics when I was in hospital after a car accident. I don't remeber the accident but I was told it was really bad. What I do remember is the game of chess and Steven the nurse who taught me how to play it. Chess just made sense to me and it felt good winning. So I spent all my time in hospital learning the moves and strategy of chess.

I'm currently in America playing an inter school competition. What I have discovered is that my normal prosthetics are too clunky when moving prieces. I often find it difficult to grab pieces and place them gently on the board.

What I need is a sports specific prosthetic so I can full fill my dream of being a chess master.

If you would like to know more about what I need please email me chessmasterdavid@outlook.com
