# Jabara
Messi is my Hero; I only want to represent Australia at the Special Olympics. My Name is Jabara, and I live to play football. Even an infection in my foot hasn't stopped me. They took my foot, and I can still attack like no one else. My Orthopaedic specialist hates me because I keep breaking her prosthetics, on the football field. I've just turned 19 and she tells me that I've stopped growing to the point that I can now get a custom prosthetic. I seriously can't wait for a blade of carbon off my stub so I can dominate the field.

I need a football-specific prosthetic so I can run, tackle, and be tackled with the best!

If you would like to know more about what I need please email me jabara@outlook.com
