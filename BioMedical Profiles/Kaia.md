Malo e lelei, my name is Kaia and I'm from the Tongan Islands. I was born blind and all I can make it is some changes in light. I;ve bene really lucky that my church and family have helped raise me. I came to Australia 2 yeras ago and I don't really like it here. I'm not very good at school and my vision support teach is so annoying all she wants me to do is learn to use my cane and learn Braille. No matter how hard I try I'm just relaly really bad at it. I'm in year 8 and all I want to do is find my way easily arround school without my cane and hang out with my friends becuase they make school worthwhile.

If you would like to know more about what I need please email me chessmasterdavid@outlook.com
