This I'm Mohey and I'm pissed! I've been working with my uncle in construction since I dropped out of high school. He never wore dust musts so neither did I, now I'm stuffeded. The doctors think it's from a bunch of kitchen benches we installed last year but now it feels like I'm breathing through a straw. All I need is to earn money again!

If you would like to know more about what I need please email me chessmasterdavid@outlook.com
