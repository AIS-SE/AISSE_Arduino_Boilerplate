My friends call me VV which is short for Volleyball Viv! Ms Bolton my volleyball coach thinks I could make the Australian Olympic team for Italy 2026. I train every morning, recess and lunch at school. Two months ago I was training really hard and then I collapsed. Good news is I'm OK bad news is they had to put a stent in my heart. My cardiologist has given me the green light to start training again. But... I can't excerpt myself too hard. 

I need a device that can monitor my exertion and warn me if I'm training to hard.

Like all good Volleyball students I never truent class to train. So if you need to ask me any questions please email me vvv@outlook.com
