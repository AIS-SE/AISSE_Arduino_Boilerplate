Hi, my name is Aaron, and I love to bush walk and rock climb. A few years ago, I was hiking in the Utah mountains in America when I fell through a crevasse, and a large boulder crushed my arm forearm. Long story short, I now don't have a right arm, making climbing and performing daily activities difficult. Mostly I really miss being able to rock climb.

What I need is a sports-specific prosthetic so I can climb agian!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me aaron@outlook.com

## Summary of Medical notes
- Mid-section rans-radial amputations of the right arm
- Amputations due to trauma beyond repair
- No adherent scar tissue
- Ulnohumeral joint is healthy and articulates normally
