# Anna
Hi, my name is Anna, I love to game, I love all sorts of games, but mostly, I love platformers and infinite runners. I was born with Muscular dystrophy, and my doctors tell me it is getting worse. About 4 years ago I was finding keyboards too difficult, and I found freedom when someone showed me how to connect an xBox controller to my PC. But in the last month, I stopped being able to use my xBox controller because the buttons are too sensitive and too small.

What I really need is a game controller just for me!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me anna@outlook.com
