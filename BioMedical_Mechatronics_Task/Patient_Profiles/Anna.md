# Anna
Hi, my name is Anna, I love to game, I love all sorts of games, but mostly, I love platformers and infinite runners. I was born with muscular dystrophy, and my doctors tell me it is getting worse. About four years ago, I was finding keyboards too difficult, but I found freedom when someone showed me how to connect an Xbox controller to my PC. Sadly, in the last month, I stopped being able to use my Xbox controller, which really sucks, just because the buttons and joystick are too sensitive and too small.

What I really need is a game controller just for me!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me anna@outlook.com
