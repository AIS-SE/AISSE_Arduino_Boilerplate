# David
Hi, my name is David, and I want to be a chess master! I'm pretty good at chess, and I have been winning competitions all over Australia since I was 10. A specialist nurse taught me chess as a way of learning to use my prosthetics while I was in hospital after a car accident. I don't remember the accident, but I was told it was pretty bad. I remember chess and Steven, the nurse who taught me how to play it. Chess just made sense to me, and it felt good winning. So I spent all my time in the hospital learning the moves and strategies of chess. I'm currently in America playing in an inter-school competition. I have discovered that my normal prosthetics are too clunky when moving pieces. I often find it challenging to grab chess pieces and place them gently on the board.

What I need is a sports-specific prosthetic so I can full fill my dream of being a chess master!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me david@outlook.com
