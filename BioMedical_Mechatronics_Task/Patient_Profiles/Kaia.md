# Kaia
Malo e lelei, my name is Kaia, and I'm from the Tongan Islands. I was born blind, and all I can see is some changes in light. I've been fortunate that my church and family have helped raise me. I came to Australia two years ago, and I don't really like it here. I'm not very good at school, and my vision support teacher is so annoying. All she wants me to do is learn to use my cane and learn Braille. No matter how hard I try, I'm just bad at it. I'm in year 8, and all I want to do is find my way easily around school without my cane and hang out with my friends because they make school worthwhile.

What I want is to get rid of that stupid cane!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me kaia@outlook.com
