# Michelle
My name is Michelle, and I'm a chief comptroller for one of Sydney's top 5 Law firms. My Job is very stressful, and I work long hours. My doctor has told me for a while that I'm at high risk for cardiovascular disease. I love to work hard, and I am very proud of my work for my firm. My cardiologist told me I had a mild heart attack about two months ago and that I need to make some lifestyle changes urgently.

What I need is something to help me make those changes.

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me michelle@outlook.com
