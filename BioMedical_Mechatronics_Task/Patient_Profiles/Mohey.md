# Mohey
I'm Mohey, and I'm pissed! I've been working with my uncle in construction since I dropped out of high school. He never wore dust musts, so neither did I, now I'm stuffed. The doctors think it's from cutting a bunch of artificial stone kitchen benches we installed last year, but now it feels like I'm breathing through a straw, and I can't work in the job I love. All I need is to earn money again!

I need something to let me know when I'm risking my lungs so I can avoid that work!

If you would like to know more about what I need, please email me mohey@outlook.com
