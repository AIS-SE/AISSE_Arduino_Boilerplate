# Vivian
My friends call me VV, which is short for Volleyball Viv! Ms Bolton, my volleyball coach, thinks I could make the Australian Olympic team for Italy 2026. I train every morning, during recess and lunch at school. Two months ago I was training really, really hard, and then I collapsed. The good news is I'm OK, the bad news is they had to put a stent in my heart. My cardiologist has given me the green light to start training again. But... I can't excerpt myself too hard. 

I need a device to monitor my exertion to start training again!

Like all good Volleyball students, I never truant class to train. So if you need to ask me any questions, please email me vivian@outlook.com
