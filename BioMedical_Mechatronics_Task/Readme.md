# Biomedical Mechatronics
Biomedical Engineering is the application of engineering principles to developing technologies and solving problems in a diverse range of healthcare-related fields. Biomedical Mechatronics is a branch of Biomedical Engineering specifically focused on engineering solutions using mechatronic components including sensors, actuators, and feedback systems managed by processing and control systems.

## Task Description
Design Situation:
Biomedical Engineering is the application of engineering principles to developing technologies and solving problems in a diverse range of healthcare-related fields. Biomedical Mechatronics is a branch of Biomedical Engineering specifically focused on engineering solutions using mechatronic components including sensors, actuators, and feedback systems managed by processing and control systems.

Design Brief:
Students will design, document, and prototype a Biomedical device specific to a patientâ€™s biomedical needs and personal requirements.
