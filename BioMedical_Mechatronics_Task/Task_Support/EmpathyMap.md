# Empathy Mapping
As UX professionals, it is our job to advocate on behalf of the user. However, in order to do it, not only must we deeply understand our users, but we must also help our colleagues understand them and prioritize their needs. Empathy maps, widely used throughout agile and design communities, are a powerful, fundamental tool for accomplishing both.
> Definition: An empathy map is a collaborative visualisation used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It externalises knowledge about users to create a shared understanding of user needs, and aid in decision-making.
Empathy maps should be used throughout any UX process to establish common ground among team members and to understand and prioritize user needs. In user-centered design, empathy maps are best used from the very beginning of the design process.

## The four quadrants of empathy mapping
The **Says** quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.
-	“I am allegiant to Delta because I never have a bad experience.”
-	“I want something reliable.”
-	“I don’t understand what to do from here.”

The **Thinks** quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? It is possible to have the same content in both Says and Thinks. However, pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?
-	“This is really annoying.”
-	“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”

The **Does** quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?
-	Refreshes page several times.
-	Shops around to compare prices.

The **Feels** quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?
-	Impatient: pages load too slowly
-	Confused: too many contradictory prices
-	Worried: they are doing something wrong

## Things to consider when empathy mapping a user.
Our users are complex humans. It is natural (and extremely beneficial) to see conflicting ideas between quadrants. You will also encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but negative quotes or emotions coming from the same user. This is when empathy maps become treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is our job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.
Some of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be difficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being precise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The four quadrants exist only to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we do not leave out any important dimension.
If you do not have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal that you need to perform more user research before proceeding with the design process.
