# 3D Models 
These models are provided to support rapid mechatontic prototyping. They have been deisgned and tested for TempeHS 3D printers and standard mechatronic components.

3. Fusion 360

## 3D Models
1. DC Motor Mounts - Simple L or U bracket to attached DC motors to any surface.
2. Jockey Wheel Mount - Simple friction fit mount to attached a mini jockey wheel to any surface.
3. Micro Servo Linera Actuator - Under dev.
4. Micro Servo Mount - Mount a micro servo motor - to be modified for aletraive mount positions.
5. Micro Servo Straw & Stick Mount - Easiy attach a straw or stick to a micro servo motor.
6. Servo Actuator - Under dev.
7. Sliding Micro Servo Claw - Simple claw mechanisim using a micro servo motor.
8. Ultrasonic Sensor & Micro Servo Motor Mount - Mount a ultrasonic sensor on a server motor.
9. Ultrasonic Sensor Mount - Simple L mount to mount a untrasonic sensor on any surface including on a micro servo motor gear.

### 3D Models need work
1. Sliding claw needs cod for metal microserver
2. servo actuator needs adjusting for printers
3. Mod micro servo kmmout for side mount
4. Micro servo liner actuator needs checking
